## 🔥 Quick Deploy Methods

### **Method 1: Git Integration (Recommended)**

1. **Push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket:**
   ```bash
   # If you haven't added a remote yet:
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your repository
   - **No configuration needed** - Netlify will automatically use `netlify.toml`

3. **Deploy automatically:**
   - Every push to main branch = automatic deployment
   - Pull requests = deploy previews

### **Method 2: Manual Deploy**

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag & drop the `dist/` folder
   - Done! ✨
